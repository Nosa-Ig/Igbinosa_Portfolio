# Project 1: Healthcare Insurance Cost Prediction: Project Overview
* Predicted hospitalisation costs using advanced regression and Gradient Boosting models with stratified 5-fold cross-validation.
*	Engineered high-impact features including age calculation, gender extraction from names, and medical risk factor transformations.
*	Identified key cost drivers such as smoking, BMI, hospital tier, and major surgeries through statistical testing and feature importance analysis.
*	Performed end-to-end healthcare analytics, integrating multiple datasets (medical, demographic, hospital) into a unified predictive framework.
*	 Applied robust ML techniques including Ridge regularisation, hyperparameter tuning, sklearn pipelines, and bias-variance optimisation.
*	 Delivered actionable business insights through SQL analysis and Tableau dashboards for strategic insurance pricing decisions.
