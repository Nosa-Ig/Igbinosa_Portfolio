# [Project 1: Healthcare Insurance Cost Prediction: Project Overview](https://github.com/Nosa-Ig/Igbinosa_Portfolio/tree/main/Healthcare_Insurance_Project)
* Predicted hospitalisation costs using advanced regression and Gradient Boosting models with stratified 5-fold cross-validation.
*	Engineered high-impact features including age calculation, gender extraction from names, and medical risk factor transformations.
*	Identified key cost drivers such as smoking, BMI, hospital tier, and major surgeries through statistical testing and feature importance analysis.
*	Performed end-to-end healthcare analytics, integrating multiple datasets (medical, demographic, hospital) into a unified predictive framework.
*	 Applied robust ML techniques including Ridge regularisation, hyperparameter tuning, sklearn pipelines, and bias-variance optimisation.
*	 Delivered actionable business insights through SQL analysis and Tableau dashboards for strategic insurance pricing decisions.

# [Project 2: Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing ML: Project Overview](https://github.com/Nosa-Ig/Igbinosa_Portfolio/tree/main/Mercedes-Benz%20Greener%20Manufacturing)
*	Built a machine learning model to predict vehicle test bench time and optimise production efficiency.
*	 Applied feature selection, label encoding, and PCA to streamline high-dimensional configuration data.
*	 Leveraged XGBoost to model complex feature interactions and improve prediction accuracy.
*	 Enabled smarter scheduling and reduced emissions by minimising unnecessary testing time.
# Code and Technical Stack
*	Developed the solution in Python using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost.
*	 Built and tested the model in Google Colab.
*	 Used the provided Mercedes-Benz train and test datasets for training and prediction.

# [Project 3: Sales Forecasting and Warehouse Optimisation System](https://github.com/Nosa-Ig/Igbinosa_Portfolio/tree/main/Sales%20Forecasting%20and%20Warehouse%20Optimisation%20System%20using%20Deep%20Learning)
* Developed a multi-horizon deep learning model (Conv1D + BiLSTM) to forecast retail sales 4 weeks ahead across stores and products.
* Built a scalable Google Cloud pipeline (BigQuery + Vertex AI + GPU) training on 1.5M+ time-series windows.
* Leveraged categorical embeddings to model store, product, and regional demand variability.
* Translated demand forecasts into warehouse stock allocation and distribution optimisation recommendations.
* Implemented business-aligned evaluation metrics (RMSE, WMAPE) with GPU benchmarking for production readiness.
# Code and Technical Stack
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) for data processing and feature engineering.
